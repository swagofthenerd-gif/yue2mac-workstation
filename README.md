## Introduction

YuE2Mac is a native macOS desktop application that brings the open [**YuE2**](https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/YuE) music-generation model — ported to **Apple MLX** — directly to your Apple Silicon Mac. Type some lyrics, pick a style, and the app plans the arrangement, composes the melody, refines the sound, and renders a full **48 kHz stereo song** — completely offline.

Powered by YuE2 (a Mixture-of-Transformers model) running at 8-bit on the Apple GPU, YuE2Mac requires no internet connection, no API keys, and nothing leaves your machine. Your lyrics and your songs stay on your Mac.

> **Original models & research:** [YuE project page](https://map-yue2.github.io) · [YuE on GitHub](https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/YuE) · [MERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00107)

## ✨ Top Features

*   🌸 **Lyrics + Style → Song:** Write your own lyrics or load a built-in sample set, describe the sound, and get a full song.
*   🎲 **Style Shuffle (non-AI):** Press the ↻ arrow next to **Style prompt** to cycle through a bundled list of ready-made style starters — no AI, just ideas.
*   🧠 **Model Version Choice:** The installer pre-selects a model (**8-bit / 4-bit / bf16**) based on your Mac's RAM and spec, then downloads exactly that one.
*   🪗 **Planning (COT):** *Full* writes a chord-annotated chart, *Melody only* writes a melody outline, *Off* goes straight to audio for speed.
*   🎚 **Quality Controls:** Refinement steps, CFG (how strictly it follows your style), song length, and a reproducible seed.
*   🎼 **ABC Score:** When planning is on, the generated ABC notation is saved alongside the song and can be opened with one click.
*   🎹 **Instrumental Mode:** One switch injects *instrumental, no vocals* and strips lyrics to structure tags — taming the model's vocal bias.
*   ❓ **Help Icons:** Every control has an explanation icon (hover for a tooltip, click for a quick card).
*   🎨 **Ambient Themes:** Studio / Stage / Vinyl — animated ambient backgrounds that adapt with the UI.
*   ⚡ **Smart Resource Handling:** The engine runs as a child process and is unloaded from memory the moment a song finishes, keeping your Mac responsive.
*   📦 **Self-Contained, One-Button Setup:** One press downloads the engine + model from Hugging Face, builds a private Python environment, and installs it all in the app's own folder — you never pick files or folders.

## ⚙️ Requirements

The app sets up its own Python environment and dependencies automatically. Beforehand you need:

*   **macOS 14.0 (Sonoma)** or later.
*   **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4/M4 Pro…)** Mac.
*   **[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):** Provides the Python ABI used to bootstrap the app's private virtual environment. (If missing, the setup screen gives you the exact command.)
*   **Internet Connection:** Only on first launch, to download the engine code, the MLX/numpy/tiktoken packages, and the model weights once. After that the app works fully offline.

## 📥 Installation

1.  Build & run (see [Building](#building-and-running)), or download the latest `.app` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/arinltte/YuE2Mac/releases/latest).
2.  On first launch, the **Setup screen** shows your Mac's spec (chip + RAM) and pre-selects a **model version**:
    *   **8-bit** — best quality/size balance, recommended for 16 GB+.
    *   **4-bit** — smallest, better for 8–12 GB Macs.
    *   **bf16** — highest fidelity, needs 28 GB+.
3.  Press **“Download & Install”** — that's it. YuE2Mac automatically:
    *   builds a private Python virtual environment (`~/Library/Application Support/YuE2Mac/Python`) and installs `mlx`, `numpy`, `tiktoken`;
    *   downloads the YuE2 engine code and your chosen model weights from Hugging Face (`Models/<variant>/`);
    *   verifies everything, then switches you straight to the composer.
4.  Done — fully offline from then on.

> **First download size:** the engine code is tiny, but the model weights are large — about **4.2 GB** for the default 8-bit model (3.4 GB 4-bit, 7 GB bf16). It only downloads once.

> **Notarization note:** like many local-LLM tools, the app may be blocked by Gatekeeper. If so, run:
> `xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/YuE2Mac.app`

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Style:** Describe the mood/instruments, or press the **↻ arrow** to shuffle a ready-made starter.
2.  **Lyrics:** Type your lyrics with structure tags (`[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`…), use the tag buttons, or press **Samples** to load a built-in set.
3.  **Planning & Quality:** pick *Full / Melody / Off*, then set steps, CFG, length, and (optionally) a seed for reproducible takes.
4.  **Generate:** press **Generate Song**. Watch friendly progress in the bottom-left panel; the big button becomes **Stop** while it works.
5.  **Enjoy:** play the result inline, open the **ABC score**, or **Show in Finder**.

## 🧠 Feature explanations

*   **Style shuffle (↻):** cycles through a `Presets.swift` list of ~10 starter styles. It doesn't call AI — it's a rotating list so you never stare at a blank box.
*   **Help icons (❓):** each slider/switch shows a tooltip on hover and a short explainer card on click.
*   **Samples (lyrics):** loads ready-made lyric sets, including an **Instrumental only** template.
*   **Instrumental:** adds `instrumental, no vocals` to the prompt and keeps only the structural tags from your lyrics.
*   **Planning (COT):** *Full* = plans chords + melody, *Melody only* = melody outline, *Off* = straight to audio (fastest, may lose the beat).
*   **CFG:** how strictly the model follows your style prompt. Higher = more obedient, possibly less creative.
*   **Seed:** same lyrics + same seed = the same song. Leave blank for a random take.

## 🔬 Tested Generation (M4 · 16 GB · 8-bit)

A real run was benchmarked on a base **M4 MacBook Pro with 16 GB RAM** using the **8-bit** engine with this input:

> **Style:** `English, soft rock, 70s feel, smooth bass, electric piano, brushed drums`

> **Lyrics:**
> ```
> [Verse]
> I took my time, I took the slow lane
> Learned to love the quiet rain
>
> [Chorus]
> I bloomed when nobody was watching
> Good things come late, and that's okay
>
> [Verse]
> All my once-upons grew roots at last
> I stopped replaying failed takes from the past
>
> [Chorus]
> I bloomed when nobody was watching
> Good things come late, and that's okay
> ```

| Metric | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| Model | YuE2-3B, 8-bit MLX |
| Memory used during generation | **~11.4 GB** of the 16 GB system |
| Device | Apple M4 · 16 GB unified memory |
| Output | 48 kHz stereo WAV |

Because the engine runs as its own child process, all ~11.4 GB is **released the moment the song finishes** — nothing stays pinned in RAM, so your Mac doesn't stay laggy after a session.

## 🔒 Data & Privacy

All generation happens locally on your GPU. No telemetry, no cloud APIs.
